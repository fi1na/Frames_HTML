# Frames_HTML
Here is a simple website I created using frames in HTML. In the top frame, the name of company is visible. In the right frame, the company profile is displayed and in the left frame 2 hyperlinks such as Our Product and Contact Us are displayed which are linked to their respective pages. On clicking any of these links, the corresponding pages are presented in the right frame.
